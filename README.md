# RogueBoxCat
This repository contains the main files of my master's degree project which I've been working on for a few months.

These files are a partial internationalization and localization to Catalan of the video game RogueBox Adventures developed by themightyglider, you can download the game from this link:
https://themightyglider.itch.io/roguebox-adventures

In order for the game to work, you'll also need to download and install pygame from: 
https://www.pygame.org/news

I used Fluent, mainly fluent.runtime, (https://github.com/projectfluent/python-fluent) for the internationalization process. The syntax it's quite easy once you get the hang of it, you can look up on the Internet for more information, but I'll give you the main pages which contain information about its syntax and use:
https://projectfluent.org/fluent/guide/text.html 
https://projectfluent.org/python-fluent/fluent.runtime/stable/usage.html

If you plan on playing the game on Catalan, you just need to do the following:
  1. Download the game from the link posted above, I recommend downloading the source version.
  2. Download the files from my repository. The l10n folder contains the files with the extracted text from the game. The main.py file contains the main code of the game.
  3. Paste both the folder and the main.py file in the game folder.
  4. That's pretty much it!

Again, this internationalization process is only partial, I'm really still missing a lot of stuff.

Feel free to modify, download and change anything to your heart's desire!
